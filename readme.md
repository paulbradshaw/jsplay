# What's here?

This repo contains a bunch of files that feed the GitHub Pages site at [paulbradshaw.github.io/jsplay](https://paulbradshaw.github.io/jsplay/). That includes:

* Responsive webpages using [the Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Automatically converting a CSV file into a HTML table using [this code](http://bl.ocks.org/ndarville/7075823). Useful for creating automatic tables on pages - and then converting into charts
* Using [D3](https://d3js.org/) to create a line chart

## On the neverending to-do list

* [Datatables](https://datatables.net/). Already done but needs to be put on here.
* [Factmint](https://github.com/factmint/Charts) turns HTML tables into charts. Pretty easy stuff.
* All the other D3 stuff. I've done a network chart and a [chord diagram](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/uberdata/) and just need to get those on here.
* Leaflet and Mapbox for maps
* Protovis - [matrix charts](http://mbostock.github.io/protovis/ex/matrix.html)
* [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/). Not really JS, but...
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
