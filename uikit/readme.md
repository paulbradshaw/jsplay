# Playing with UIKit

Following [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SfpsC7cy0gv9O7nNKyQZBrFjhi3LH-V). Skip the first video providing an overview.

The second video links to a Codepen at https://codepen.io/floriandotpy/pen/raoBja and a more developed version at https://codepen.io/paulbradshaw/pen/zYaVwxJ - look in the settings for the JS panel to see the CDNJS links.

Note the order: JQuery first, then UIKit. 

The JQuery link is //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js - but [search on CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery) to find the latest version: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.2/jquery.min.js

The UIKit link is https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/2.18.0/js/uikit.min.js - but the [latest version](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/uikit) is now: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/3.15.18/js/uikit.min.js

Don't forget the CSS links as well. In the settings there's one: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/2.18.0/css/uikit.almost-flat.min.css - there's no similarly-named CSS file on CDNJS but the latest CSS is https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/uikit/3.15.18/css/uikit-core-rtl.min.css

Replacing the old CSS link with that new one does change the appearance, but it's still being styled.
